This project analyzes Amazon consumer reviews based on beauty products to explore how textual feedback correlates with perceived product quality. We use transformer-based models (BERT) for sentence embeddings and regression analysis to evaluate rating deviations.


This study examines the relationship between customer sentiment and perceived product quality in Amazon's Beauty category. By embedding review text using a pre-trained BERT model and applying multiple regression techniques, we assess whether linguistic features in reviews can explain deviations from average product ratings. The goal is to uncover sentiment-driven patterns that inform marketing strategy and enhance consumer trust. 

Our results show that textual sentiment moderately predicts rating behavior, particularly when regularized appropriately, highlighting both the potential and limitations of NLP-based modeling in e-commerce contexts.
